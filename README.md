# thePackage
A 2-dimensional game engine built for progressing java developers. It handles image displaying, object movement, text printing, collision detection, file loading, sound playing, and key listening. At the same time, it keeps programmers as close and familiar with the code as possible, requiring use of an IDE and few pre-built game objects.
